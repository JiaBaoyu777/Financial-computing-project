Proposal:
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Collect historical stock price data of Cambricon Technologies Corporation Limited, and perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Stationarity Testing
Check whether the data is stationary. Use the ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test to determine if the data requires differencing.
3. Differencing
If the data is non-stationary, apply differencing to make it stationary in preparation for modeling.
4. Model Fitting
Fit the model using ARIMA / GARCH
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the modelâ€™s fitting performance, and assess the model through residual checks and prediction accuracy.
6. Forecasting & Analysis
Use the fitted model to forecast stock prices, and perform a comparative analysis.
